# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |

| 9.0.x   | ✅ |
| < 9.0   | ❌ (legacy Python AEGIS — unsupported) |

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Obscura Scan **itself** (not in a target
you scanned), please report it responsibly:

- **Do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.
- Email the maintainers or use GitHub's private security advisory at
  <https://github.com/security-life-org/Obscura/security/advisories>.
- **Email:** [security@security-life.org](mailto:security@security-life.org)
- Include: affected version, a description, reproduction steps, and impact.

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few business days and to ship a fix or
mitigation as quickly as is practical. Please give us reasonable time to remediate
before public disclosure.

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 2 business days of report receipt.
- **Triage & Assessment:** Within 7 business days.
- **Fix & Release:** Best-effort within 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others.
- **Public Disclosure:** Coordinated with the reporter after the fix is released.

### Acknowledgments

We gratefully credit researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. With your permission, your name (or handle) will be listed in the release notes and CHANGELOG for the version containing the fix.

## Responsible & authorized use

Obscura Scan is a **dual-use security tool**. It performs active reconnaissance
including exposed-file probing, port scanning, subdomain-takeover detection, and
cloud-bucket enumeration.

- **Only scan systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test.**
- Unauthorized scanning may violate computer-misuse laws in your jurisdiction.
- The authors accept no liability for misuse. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Built-in safety controls

Obscura Scan is designed to be safe to operate:

- **SSRF guard (default-on).** Every outbound request is dialed through a guarded
  transport that inspects the *resolved* IP at connect time and refuses to connect to:
  loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`), link-local incl. cloud metadata
  (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`, `169.254.169.254`), private ranges
  (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `fc00::/7`), and other reserved/special-use
  ranges. Because the check runs at *connect* time and on every redirect hop, it
  defeats DNS-rebinding and redirect-based bypasses.
  - Override only for authorized internal engagements with `--allow-internal` or
    `OBSCURA_ALLOW_INTERNAL=true` (default: deny).
- **Target validation.** User input is validated/normalized before any module runs.
- **Per-host circuit breaker & bounded concurrency** to avoid hammering targets.
- **Semi-offensive modules are categorized** so operators can choose their scope.
- **Secrets are masked** in the UI, JSON export, and logs; no key is ever logged in
  full.
- **Optional API hardening:** Bearer-token auth, per-IP rate limiting, and an audit
  log on the REST API (`API_AUTH_ENABLED`, `API_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`,
  `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`).

## Handling of secrets & data

- All API keys are optional and read from the environment / `.env`. They are never
  committed; `.env` is git-ignored.
- API keys are stored only in memory (for provider calls); REST API keys are stored
  as a SHA-256 hash, never in plaintext.
- Scan results are stored locally in SQLite (`obscura.db`). Treat this database as
  sensitive — it contains reconnaissance data about your targets.
